Clients:
    irssi → terminal, clean, stable, widely used at 42 schools
    WeeChat → fancier, better UI, very nice
    HexChat → GUI, friendly
    mIRC → old Windows classic
Irssi is common simply because:
    it’s available everywhere
    it supports RFC standards well
    it’s stable and predictable
    no weird behaviour
Weechat is arguably nicer, but irssi is “the safe default.”

if i use only nonblocking sockets, in combo with poll() how do i need to design the error handling?

does server need to check length of incoming data? YES

How do we handle msgs that are outgoing & longer than 512 bytes? Is this even going to happen?



in case of server shutdown, does server need to inform clients before it closes connections?

What is the msg format for replies from server? how do we handle consistent formatting \r\n etc?(separate formatting ft? )
add a outgoing msg formatting ft to parser?


Are we gonna store channels in server class? (i think freeing is easier if in server)
